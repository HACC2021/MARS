# MARS

You can test the site out at: https://mars-wv7zfnkmyq-uw.a.run.app/MARSapp/. Our Desktop version is currently our best version. 

*For most up to date version of site, please open the application in private or incognito browsing.  This will help prevent users from seeing previous versions that are cached on local devices.

*Take note that reporting services are meant to be used exclusively on a mobile device; HMAR requests users to not report animals after leaving the area animal was sited.  The scaling on a non mobile device may be distorted.
